            <p>I am Emmett Matasovsky, a senior at Michigan State pursuing a degree in Media and Information Management. I am 21 years 
                old, having just turned 21 in August. I graduated from Lutheran High School Westland in the Spring of 2018 and 
                continued my schooling at MSU all four years. I have always held an interest in both writing and sports work, which has led 
                to the creation of this website. In "My Writings," you can see some of my writings regarding previous sporting events.</p>
