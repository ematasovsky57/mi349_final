            <article>
                <p>The date was October 16, 2021. Michigan State football was finishing up their 20-15 victory over the Indiana Hoosiers. The second the clock hit all zeros, I received a text from my friend, Mat. “Thursday or Friday?” the text said. While most college students getting that text would be deciding a party or a double date, Mat and I were discussing a much more important piece of information: when to line up for Michigan State’s home football game in two weeks. “Friday morning” was the reply, and thus, the most exhilarating 48 hours of my life were set in stone. As Michigan State was off the next weekend, I was free to head home and pick up all the supplies I would need for the upcoming week. Multiple towels, a sports umbrella, yoga mat, and sleeping bag later, I thought I was prepared. As it would turn out, I was not.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thursday of game week rolls around. I have my song of the week picked out (All Roads Lead Home by Ohana Bam) and it is time to determine who will be taking the first shift for sitting in front of the gates. Mat volunteers for 9am Friday morning, with my shift to follow. Friday comes, and the weather is miserable. It is raining, but we do not waver in our commitment. I relieve a drenched Mat at 2:30pm and set up our “camp,” consisting of an umbrella, a seat cushion, and multiple towels. When the third hour of my shift rolls around, I send out a tweet to multiple MSU beat writers. One of them, Chris Solari, retweets this and I feel the sensation of popularity. Additionally, an MSU alum messages me asking if I would like some pizza to share. I have a polite conversation with them and suddenly, the delivery driver comes with 7 pizzas in my name! I make friends as I hand out all the pizzas to keep morale up for the 50 of us who are in line with more than 16 hours before kickoff. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Game time rolls up after a cold, wet night with less than 30 minutes of sleep for me, and the morning is spent packing up camp, changing into our gameday gear, and then discussing whatever comes to mind. We are allowed into the stadium at 10:00am sharp and this is where the true drama begins. Michigan players are warming up adjacent to the student section, leading to some jawing. Players are taking pictures of flags, talking about the better team in Michigan. Disrespectfully, of course. One assistant for Michigan Football, Chris Bryant, decides now is a great time to join in the banter. He takes multiple passes at my fellow students in the front row, usually smirking or stating to let the game do the talking. 50 minutes prior to kickoff, Bryant decides to take a much darker tone now that police officers are by the student section to prevent any escalation. He points out nearly every student in the front row, stating that he can take them in a fight. Why this was necessary, I have no clue. The need for a 28-year-old man (who, ironically, had his playing career cut short for shoulder injuries) to call out and threaten people as many as 10 years his junior is beyond me. The countdown to kickoff passes in a blur, and the rest, as they say, is history. Michigan opens with momentum and can never close off the Spartans, allowing Michigan State to drive to the lead late and maintain the lead to seal the victory in a brutal, controversial game.</p>
