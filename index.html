            <article>
                <p>The date was October 16, 2021. Michigan State football was finishing up their 20-15 victory over the Indiana Hoosiers. The second the clock hit all zeros, I received a text from my friend, Mat. “Thursday or Friday?” the text said. While most college students getting that text would be deciding a party or a double date, Mat and I were discussing a much more important piece of information: when to line up for Michigan State’s home football game in two weeks. “Friday morning” was the reply, and thus, the most exhilarating 48 hours of my life were set in stone. As Michigan State was off the next weekend, I was free to head home and pick up all the supplies I would need for the upcoming week. Multiple towels, a sports umbrella, yoga mat, and sleeping bag later, I thought I was prepared. As it would turn out, I was not.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thursday of game week rolls around. I have my song of the week picked out (All Roads Lead Home by Ohana Bam) and it is time to determine who will be taking the first shift for sitting in front of the gates. Mat volunteers for 9am Friday morning, with my shift to follow. Friday comes, and the weather is miserable. It is raining, but we do not waver in our commitment. I relieve a drenched Mat at 2:30pm and set up our “camp,” consisting of an umbrella, a seat cushion, and multiple towels. When the third hour of my shift rolls around, I send out a tweet to multiple MSU beat writers. One of them, Chris Solari, retweets this and I feel the sensation of popularity. Additionally, an MSU alum messages me asking if I would like some pizza to share. I have a polite conversation with them and suddenly, the delivery driver comes with 7 pizzas in my name! I make friends as I hand out all the pizzas to keep morale up for the 50 of us who are in line with more than 16 hours before kickoff. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Game time rolls up after a cold, wet night with less than 30 minutes of sleep for me, and the morning is spent packing up camp, changing into our gameday gear, and then discussing whatever comes to mind. We are allowed into the stadium at 10:00am sharp and this is where the true drama begins. Michigan players are warming up adjacent to the student section, leading to some jawing. Players are taking pictures of flags, talking about the better team in Michigan. Disrespectfully, of course. One assistant for Michigan Football, Chris Bryant, decides now is a great time to join in the banter. He takes multiple passes at my fellow students in the front row, usually smirking or stating to let the game do the talking. 50 minutes prior to kickoff, Bryant decides to take a much darker tone now that police officers are by the student section to prevent any escalation. He points out nearly every student in the front row, stating that he can take them in a fight. Why this was necessary, I have no clue. The need for a 28-year-old man (who, ironically, had his playing career cut short for shoulder injuries) to call out and threaten people as many as 10 years his junior is beyond me. The countdown to kickoff passes in a blur, and the rest, as they say, is history. Michigan opens with momentum and can never close off the Spartans, allowing Michigan State to drive to the lead late and maintain the lead to seal the victory in a brutal, controversial game.</p>

            <h4>Game Summary- Beat Writer/Professional Style</h4>
            <article>
                <p>East Lansing, MI- At the end of ESPN’s College Gameday, the Gameday crew mostly picks Michigan over the Spartans. The game starts, and the Gameday crew appears correct. Michigan receiver Andrel Anthony Jr., an East Lansing High School product, catches his first career pass and sprints 93 yards untouched to the endzone. 10 minutes of gametime later, Michigan tacks on a Jake Moody field goal to make the game a 10-0 contest after one quarter. In the stands, the energetic crowd has calmed down, as upperclassmen remember the Michigan State teams from their freshman and sophomore years. The next drive will be crucial to keep the crowd in the game, and coordinator Jay Johnson takes the Michigan defense to school, as Michigan State runningback Kenneth Walker III cruises into the endzone on a 27-yard score at the beginning of the second. Walker appeared to be stuffed for no gain on the play but found a hole on the left side of the Michigan State line and picked up a block from Connor Heyward to wind up with 6 points. Michigan will be the next team to respond, with another Moody field goal, expanding the Wolverine’s gap to 13-7. Not to be outdone, Michigan State quickly replies with another Walker III rushing touchdown, this time from 8 yards as the Wolverines were not set on defense, giving an easy touchdown to the Spartans and their first lead of the game, 14-13. The Wolverines then turned to Anthony again, as freshman J.J. McCarthy threw a perfect pass to Andrel for a 17-yard score to regain the lead.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Then, the most controversial play of the game happened. Michigan State quarterback Payton Thorne, who was having a brutal game, was sacked, and appeared to fumble the ball. Michigan’s Aidan Hutchinson quickly scooped up the ball and stumbled 2 yards to wind up in the endzone. In a shocking call, it is overturned to just be a sack. Michigan got the ball back via a Bryce Baringer punt but was only able to tack on their third Moody field goal of the half to make the score 23-14, Wolverines, headed into break.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The momentum remained on the Wolverines’ side after half, with both sides unable to get much going but a two-possession lead for Michigan keeping the maize and blue much more relaxed. Michigan’s second drive of the second half was then cashed in for six on the arm of Cade McNamara, as Mike Sainristil caught a 16-yard pass to bring the lead to 29-14. Instead of going for two points to turn the game into a three-possession contest, coach Harbaugh chose to attempt an extra point. After all, the Spartans would need two touchdowns and two-point conversions after both, which is a low percentage play to start, before considering the Spartan’s woes. On the last State drive, the Spartans had a whopping -13 yards. Payton Thorne had thrown two interceptions so far today, and most of the offense was based around Kenneth Walker III. If the Wolverines could stop one player, they would emerge victorious and reclaim the Paul Bunyan trophy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As it turns out, they could not. The theme for the day was that every punch had a counterpunch, and Michigan State was true to form, as the Spartans drove down the field quickly. Within seven plays, the Spartans were on the Wolverines one yard line. Kenneth Walker III crossed the goal line for the third time on the day, and Tre Mosley was wide open on a slant route on the ensuing two-point conversion. 22-30, Wolverines. Michigan had the Spartans on their back foot all day, but the next drive came up short. The Wolverines had to punt after a 7-play drive, giving the Spartans the ball with the chance to tie the game. 86 yards separated the Spartans from the end zone, and 8 plays later, the Spartans faced a crucial third down. With 3 yards separating the Spartans from a first down, both the run and the pass could have been called. Jay Johnson chose to run, and who else? Kenneth Walker found a small gap. With Walker, the small gap was all it took, and a 4-yard rush became a 58-yard house call to bring the Spartans within two.  Payton Thorne threw a jump ball to his longtime friend and high school teammate Jayden Reed, and the score was tied at 30 apiece. This play was controversial, as a Michigan defender ripped the ball out of Reed’s arms and appeared to have an interception. It was determined that Reed had landed and established possession before the Wolverines took the ball away, upholding the two-point attempt. Spartan Stadium was in a frenzy, as there was just under 13 minutes of game clock remaining for either team to claim a victory. As stated before, this game was a boxing match, and Michigan got the next opportunity to swing. They took the lead back with Moody’s fourth field goal of the day. The field goal was almost a disappointment for the maize and blue faithful, as Michigan had driven close to the endzone until an unforced McCarthy fumble rolled out of bounds on third down, making Michigan settle for three. This field goal had taken the wind from the Spartan’s sails, as they went -4 yards in three plays and Baringer punted away the football. With one extended drive, or a touchdown, Michigan could nearly end the game. J.J. McCarthy came trotting out and had his second unforced fumble of the day, to which Jacub Panasiuk was on top of it. McCarthy tried to pry the ball back, but that effort was a fruitless as prying a New York strip from a starving bulldog. Michigan State now had the ball a mere 41 yards from the endzone. A few plays later, Michigan defensive lineman Mike Morris attempted to choke Walker after a play. While uncalled by the officials, the crowd was outraged. Morris had been called for multiple penalties during the game, as well as the drive, for late substitutions, so it was only natural a late hit would be added to his list. Alas, the officials did not see it and play continued. Two plays later, Morris was the one choking, this time on Walker’s dust as Walker sprinted 23 yards into the endzone. Michigan State now led 37-33 with only a few minutes remaining. Michigan had a methodical 12 play drive end from a turnover on downs. In response, the Spartans played conservatively, had three quick rushes before punting the ball away again. Michigan got the ball next for their last chance at the game. Wolverines and Spartans alike held their breath in the stadium as this next drive was the final chapter of an offseason of work. The stunning turnaround of both two win programs was coming to a culmination on this next drive. Cade McNamara was back in at quarterback and continued the game of his life. This game can only have one winner, and freshman defensive back Charles Brantley became the hero, intercepting a McNamara pass with one hand, sealing the Spartans as the last remaining undefeated Big Ten team.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The crowd voiced their opinion as the whole stadium was deafening. Hugs, high fives, and screams were seen and heard everywhere as strangers became friends as all had seen their team accomplish their one goal: sending the Wolverines home as losers. The party atmosphere in the stadium carried on, as the players ran to celebrate with the fans and family, throwing gloves and headbands into the crowd. Mel Tucker’s squad, only a few short years removed from an embarrassing 44-10 loss under the previous administration, was on top for the second year in a row.</p>
